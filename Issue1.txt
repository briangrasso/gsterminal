Currently, the LoadRegUsrLs function in main() is disabled. I need to be able to save the vector as a member of the a class to a file, and retrieve it for use in later C# development. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and is valued in G# Stablecoins. Thanks!
I believe the proper method is in the Standard Library for map and multi-map.
