 I have designed an expandable multi-language user interface and register for developing a Hebrew based programming environment. 
 The concept is derived from the construction of the guitar. The relationships of strings, frets, notes, chords, and octaves, creates database of simple characters in the form of the Hebrew language that can be used to produce unique waveforms. 
 Development of applications utilizing my environment to manipulate the order and outcome of processes will be rewarded with G# Stablecoins (currently only available for purchase, trade, and sell, on the G# Management Servcices network).
